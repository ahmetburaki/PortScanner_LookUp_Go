# Basic Concepts for Understanding Go Language Code

This document covers the fundamental concepts necessary for understanding the `lookup.go` code written in the Go language. Below, you can find the topics you need to know to comprehend this code:

1. **Basic Go Language Features**

   - Variables and Data Types: Understanding how variables are declared and different data types are used in Go.
   - Expressions and Operators: Basic knowledge of how expressions and operators, such as arithmetic, relational, and logical operators, are used.
   - Loops: Performing repetitive operations using the `for` loop.
   - Conditions: Creating conditional statements using `if`, `else if`, and `else` expressions.
   - Functions: Understanding how functions are defined, called, and work with return values.

   - Variables and Data Types:
     ```go
     var age int = 30
     var name string = "John Doe"
     ```
   - Expressions and Operators:
     ```go
     x := 5
     y := 10
     sum := x + y
     ```
   - Loops:
     ```go
     for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
         fmt.Println(i)
     }
     ```
   - Conditions:
     ```go
     if x > 10 {
         fmt.Println("x is greater than 10")
     } else if x < 10 {
         fmt.Println("x is less than 10")
     } else {
         fmt.Println("x is equal to 10")
     }
     ```
   - Functions:
     ```go
     func add(x, y int) int {
         return x + y
     }
     ```

2. **Packages and Imports**

   - Packages are imported using the `import` statement to make them available for use. This code uses the `bufio`, `fmt`, `net`, and `os` packages.

   ```go
   import (
       "fmt"
       "net"
       "os"
   )
   ```

3. **Console Input/Output**

   - Printing output to the console (`Println`, `Printf`) and receiving input from the user (`Scan`, `ReadString`) are done using the `fmt` package. In this code, user input for a domain name is taken.

   - Printing Output:
     ```go
     fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
     ```
   - Receiving Input:
     ```go
     var name string
     fmt.Print("Enter your name: ")
     fmt.Scan(&name)
     ```

4. **String Operations**

   - String manipulation operations, such as string concatenation (using the `+` operator or `Sprintf` function), string splitting, and getting the length of a string, can be performed.

   - String Concatenation:
     ```go
     str1 := "Hello"
     str2 := "World"
     result := str1 + " " + str2
     ```
   - Getting String Length:
     ```go
     str := "Hello"
     length := len(str)
     ```

5. **Error Handling**

   - Error handling is done using the `error` type and `if` statements. Understanding how to check for and handle error conditions is important. In this code, the `LookupIP` function can return an error.

   ```go
   result, err := SomeFunction()
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Error:", err)
   } else {
       fmt.Println("Result:", result)
   }
   ```

6. **Network Operations**

   - The `net` package

 is used for network operations. The `LookupIP` function is used to resolve IP addresses.

   ```go
   ipAddresses, err := net.LookupIP("www.example.com")
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Error:", err)
   } else {
       fmt.Println("IP Addresses:")
       for _, ip := range ipAddresses {
           fmt.Println(ip)
       }
   }
   ```

   This code resolves the IP addresses of the "www.example.com" domain and prints them to the console.

   1. The `net.LookupIP("www.example.com")` expression resolves the IP addresses of the "www.example.com" domain by performing a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup to find the IP addresses associated with the domain.
   2. The results are assigned to the `ipAddresses` variable and any possible error is assigned to the `err` variable.
   3. The `if err != nil` statement checks if there is an error. If an error exists, the `fmt.Println("Error:", err)` statement is executed and the error message is printed to the console.
   4. If there is no error, indicating a successful resolution, the `fmt.Println("IP Addresses:")` statement is executed to start printing the IP addresses.
   5. The `for _, ip := range ipAddresses` loop iterates over each IP address in the `ipAddresses` array.
   6. Each IP address is printed to the console using the `fmt.Println(ip)` statement.

   As a result, this code prints the resolved IP addresses of the "www.example.com" domain. If the resolution process is successful, the IP addresses are displayed in order. If an error occurs, an error message is printed to the console.
